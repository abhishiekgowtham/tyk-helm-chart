## Tyk-pro

This is a modified copy of the original [tyk-pro](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-helm-chart/tree/master/tyk-pro) helm chart to test some new functionalities. All you need to do is to add licenses for mdcd and dashboard in the `values.yaml` and you're good to go. 

It's kinda like a preview on how tyk-pro should look like or work once more components get added as dependencies and all existng templates are deleted.
